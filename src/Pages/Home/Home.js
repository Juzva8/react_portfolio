     <h3>I am a former CEO and founder of a transport company with almost one hundred employees. 
       I was born in central Europe where studied Psychology for two years and later I decided to get a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. 
       I am fluent in three languages. I can speak in one of the oldest Proto-Indo-European language as well as Russian. I can write and read in Cyrillic script and I am fluent in English. 
       I moved to the United States in 2017. Since I got into tech and coding that is why in June of 2020 I decided to sell my company and started UCLA extension for full-stack web developer 
       boot camp which I graduated in February of 2021. I committed my all-time to get better learning front and back end web development but that's not it. 
       Rest of my free time I spent on the coding academy and other online courses learning other coding languages.
